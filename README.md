<h1> Road to Gen AI </h1>


A collection of mini projects showcasing my journey to General Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI). This repository contains a variety of projects on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Gen AI.


About this Repository


This repository is a reflection of my commitment to learning and exploring the vast expanse of AI. Each mini project represents a small step towards achieving Gen AI, and I hope to update this repository frequently with new projects.


Project Categories


- Machine Learning: Projects that explore the basics of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Deep Learning: Projects that delve into the world of deep learning, including neural networks and convolutional neural networks.
- NLP: Projects that focus on natural language processing, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and language modeling.
- Gen AI: Projects that aim to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, including generative models and cognitive architectures.

Project Structure


Each project will have its own folder, containing:


- README.md: A brief description of the project, including its objectives, methodology, and results.
- code/: The source code for the project, including any necessary dependencies.
- data/: Any datasets or data files used in the project.
